The YOLOv5 model is superior for capturing contextual features and localizing bearings within stacked bearing images, a task that histogram-based models cannot perform. To achieve even better results, consider fine-tuning with a balanced dataset, enhancing the architecture, or experimenting with alternative deep learning models.
- YOLOv5 excels at contextual feature extraction.
- It can localize bearings in stacked bearing images, unlike histogram-based models.
- Further improvements can be achieved by fine-tuning with a balanced dataset, enhancing the architecture, or experimenting with different DL models.
