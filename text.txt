**Image Quality Assessment on Metal Image**

Image quality assessment (IQA) is a task that aims to measure the perceptual quality of images, especially in the presence of distortions or artifacts. IQA can be useful for various applications, such as evaluating image capture pipelines, storage techniques, and sharing media. IQA can also be applied to specific domains, such as metal surface defect detection, material processing, and quality assurance.

There are two main types of IQA methods: reference-based and no-reference. Reference-based methods compare the distorted image with a reference image that is assumed to be of high quality, and compute a similarity score based on some metrics. No-reference methods do not require a reference image, and instead rely on features extracted from the distorted image, such as naturalness, structure, or texture.

Some of the research papers and models that are related to IQA on metal image are:

- **Image Data Assessment Approach for Deep Learning-Based Metal Surface Defect-Detection Systems**⁵: This paper proposes a comprehensive assessment score that combines defect visibility, visibility distribution, and overexposure based on the operation principles of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The score can be used to assess whether the training image dataset can improve the defect detection rate of the deep learning models, such as You Only Look Once (YOLO), Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), and Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), without training defect image datasets. The paper compares the proposed approach with existing IQA methods, such as mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), universal image quality index (UIQI), natural image quality evaluator (NIQE), perception-based quality evaluator (PIQE), and blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE). The experiment results indicate that the proposed comprehensive assessment score is more correlated to the F2-score of the detection models than the IQA methods.

- **Deep Learning Approaches to Image Texture Analysis in Material Processing**⁶: This paper compares three traditional approaches, based on the use of grey level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM), local binary patterns (LBP), and textons, with five transfer learning approaches, based on the use of AlexNet, VGG19, ResNet50, GoogLeNet, and MobileNetV2, for image texture analysis in material processing. The paper uses two simulated and one real-world case study, where the appearance of ultrahigh carbon steel is cast as a textural pattern recognition problem. The paper evaluates the ability of random forest models, as well as the CNNs themselves, to discriminate between different textures with the image features as input. The paper finds that the texton algorithm performed better than the LBP and GLCM algorithms and similar to the deep learning approaches when these were used directly, without any retraining. Partial or full retraining of the CNNs yielded considerably better results, with GoogLeNet and MobileNetV2 yielding the best results.

- **Metallographic Image Analysis for Quality Assurance of Metals: A Review**¹: This paper reviews the literature on metallographic analysis, which is crucial in the study of metallic materials because it provides information about properties (yield strength, tensile strength, elongation), which has a direct impact on material. The paper observes that image processing is widely used in the metallographic microstructure analysis, and morphological and contour-based image processing techniques are applied to calculate grain size. The paper also discusses the challenges and future directions of metallographic image analysis, such as improving the efficiency and accuracy of analysis, developing ultramicroscopy-based methods, and integrating artificial intelligence techniques.

- **Evaluation of the quality of CT images acquired with smart metal artifact reduction (SMAR) algorithm in patients with hip arthroplasty**⁷: This paper evaluates the quality of CT images acquired with smart metal artifact reduction (SMAR) algorithm in patients with hip arthroplasty, which is a common source of metal artifacts that degrade the image quality and diagnostic accuracy. The paper uses both subjective and objective methods to assess the image quality and the reduction of metal artifacts. Subjectively, three radiologists evaluated image quality and assigned a score for visualization of anatomic structures in the critical areas of interest. Objectively, the absolute CT value of the difference (ΔCT) and artifacts index (AI) were adopted in this study for the quantitative assessment of metal artifacts. The paper reports that the SMAR algorithm significantly improved the image quality and reduced the metal artifacts in patients with hip arthroplasty.

- **Image quality assessment via multiple features**⁴: This paper proposes a novel no-reference IQA method that is based on multiple features. For each image, the paper extracts natural sense statistic feature, global structural feature, and local structural feature, respectively. Then, the paper uses a support vector machine (SVM) to combine these features and predict the image quality score. The paper compares the proposed method with several state-of-the-art IQA methods on four benchmark databases: LIVE, CSIQ, TID2013, and LIVE Multiply Distorted. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method achieves better performance than the existing methods in terms of correlation coefficients and consistency.
