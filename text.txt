As today is my last day, I wanted to express how lucky I feel to have had a manager like you. Your support and guidance have been invaluable, and I am very grateful for everything you've done. I hope to have the privilege of working with someone like you in the future.



Hi Harsh,

It's been a great experience working with you and learning new skills from you. Your ability to handle pressure and your working style have truly impressed me. I appreciate how you helped me with the project, taking on the work and dividing it according to our strengths. Seeing you manage all the technical aspects of the projects was very inspiring, and I hope to apply the same practices in my future endeavors.

Thank you for everything, Harsh. I hope we can stay in touch!


It's been great working with you. You've been so supportive and friendly, never letting age be a barrier to our communication. Iâ€™ve appreciated how smoothly and openly we've been able to talk. I will definitely learn from your behavior and apply it in my entire life and with colleagues in future companies.

Thank you for everything!
