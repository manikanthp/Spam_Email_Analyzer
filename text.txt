Designed and deployed a high-throughput image quality test & classification mobile app for analyzing user-captured images.
Optimized serverless architecture on AWS: Leveraged AWS S3, Lambda, SageMaker, API Gateway & CloudWatch to achieve cost-efficient scalability and real-time image processing.
On-device & cloud model expertise: Trained both lightweight on-device image quality model for mobile and high-accuracy image classification model on SageMaker in the cloud.
Data-driven optimization & cost savings: Employed AutoML, spot instances, serverless functions, and lifecycle policies to minimize infrastructure costs.
