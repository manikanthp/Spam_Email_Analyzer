There are several challenges in the current process that can be significantly alleviated by implementing an AI model.

Firstly, the total turnaround time is extended because the image quality checks are conducted manually by the Techline agent. If the images do not meet the required standards, the agent must communicate back to the technicians, requesting retakes. This back-and-forth process can be time-consuming and inefficient.

Secondly, the Techline agent is responsible for manually assessing the images to determine the type of wear. This assessment requires the expertise of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to accurately judge the condition and recommend the appropriate repair method. This reliance on manual evaluation by an SME further contributes to delays and potential inconsistencies in the assessment process.

By leveraging an AI model, these challenges can be addressed more efficiently, reducing the turnaround time and ensuring more consistent and accurate evaluations.
