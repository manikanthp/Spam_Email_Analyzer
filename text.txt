We are updating our process for assessing image quality, wear type, and repair instructions by integrating human review into the AI judgment workflow. 

When a technician takes pictures using our AI mobile app, the images are sent for quality checks via the image advisory model. If the images do not meet the required quality standards, the model will notify the technician to retake the images, providing suggestions for improvement. Once satisfactory images are obtained, they are forwarded to the defect identification model, which classifies the wear type. 

Based on the wear type identified, the system suggests appropriate repair methods for the most severe cases. These suggestions are then reviewed and approved by an HCC agent via the web app. Once approved, the process triggers the sending of emails and the ordering of parts, which are then shipped to the dealer. The technician completes the repairs using the provided parts.
